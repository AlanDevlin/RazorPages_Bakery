# ASP.NET Razor Pages

This is a basic example of using ASP.NET Razor Pages to design a small website.

To complete this project I did the following:
  - Added new pages to the template, and adding them to the navigation.
  - Created a Products model to keep control of all the products in the bakery.
  - Mapped my model to a database by using the **Entity Framework**, including adding and registering a *context*.
  - Populated database with seed data by using a *Model Builder*.
  - Retrieved the data from the database and displayed it on the web page.
